# T5 Sentiment Analysis MLOps Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for a custom **T5 Sentiment Analysis Model**. It features a specialized T5 Encoder with a "Sentiment Gate" architecture, deployed to **AWS SageMaker Serverless Inference**, and orchestrated by **Apache Airflow**.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The core of this project is a custom `T5ForSentimentClassification` model that modifies the standard T5 architecture for efficient and interpretable binary sentiment classification.

<!-- ![Model Architecture](assets/architecture_diagram.png) -->

### Key Components:
1.  **T5 Encoder Backbone**: We use only the encoder part of `t5-small`. This reduces inference latency significantly compared to the full encoder-decoder architecture, as we don't need to generate text token-by-token.
2.  **Sentiment Gate**: A learnable attention mechanism (Linear layer + Sigmoid) that assigns an "importance score" ($0$ to $1$) to each token's hidden state. This allows the model to focus on sentiment-bearing words (e.g., "loved", "terrible") while ignoring neutral ones.
3.  **Weighted Pooling**: Instead of simple mean pooling, we compute a weighted sum of the encoder's hidden states using the gate scores.
    $$ h_{pooled} = \frac{\sum (h_i \times g_i)}{\sum g_i} $$
4.  **Classification Head**: A final dense layer maps the pooled representation to 2 classes (Negative/Positive).

### 🔍 Sentiment Gate Example

To understand how the gate works, consider the sentence: **"The visual effects were stunning, but the plot was boring."**

The **Sentiment Gate** analyzes each token and assigns a score based on its contribution to the overall sentiment.

| Token | Gate Score (0-1) | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `The` | 0.05 | Irrelevant (Stop word) |
| `visual` | 0.20 | Context |
| `effects` | 0.20 | Context |
| `were` | 0.05 | Irrelevant |
| `stunning` | **0.95** | **Strong Positive Signal** |
| `,` | 0.01 | Irrelevant |
| `but` | 0.40 | Contrast Marker |
| `the` | 0.05 | Irrelevant |
| `plot` | 0.30 | Context |
| `was` | 0.05 | Irrelevant |
| `boring` | **0.98** | **Strong Negative Signal** |

**How it works:**
*   The model computes a weighted average of the token embeddings.
*   The embeddings for **"stunning"** and **"boring"** will dominate the final representation because of their high gate scores.
*   Neutral words like "The" or "was" are effectively filtered out.
*   The final classifier sees a representation that is a mix of "stunning" and "boring" (and "but"), allowing it to make a nuanced decision.

### Reinforcement Learning (RL) Optimization
The model utilized RL training loop where the Gate is treated as a policy. It uses the **REINFORCE** algorithm to optimize the gate to maximize classification accuracy, encouraging it to select the most predictive tokens.

## � Performance & Data

### Dataset: SST-2 (GLUE Benchmark)
We use the **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)** dataset from the GLUE benchmark.
*   **Train Set**: ~67,349 examples
*   **Validation Set**: 872 examples

### Accuracy Comparison
| Model | Accuracy | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Original T5-Base** | **91.80%** | [Raffel et al., 2020 (JMLR)](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) |
| **T5-Small + Sentiment Gate** | **91.17%** | Our Implementation |

*Note: While our gated approach sees a slight drop in accuracy, it offers significantly faster inference (encoder-only) and interpretability (gate scores).*

## �🔄 MLOps Pipeline

The entire lifecycle of the model is automated using **Apache Airflow**, ensuring reproducibility and continuous delivery.

### Pipeline Steps:
1.  **Check Data**: Validates that the SST-2 dataset is available and correctly formatted.
2.  **Train / Check Model**:
    *   Checks if a pre-trained model exists locally (hybrid workflow).
    *   If not, triggers a training job (supports GPU acceleration).
3.  **Evaluate**: Runs the model against the validation set to ensure performance metrics (Accuracy > 90%) are met.
4.  **Package Model**: Compresses the model artifacts (`pytorch_model.bin`, `config.json`, `tokenizer`) and inference scripts (`inference.py`) into a `model.tar.gz` file compatible with SageMaker.
5.  **Deploy to SageMaker**:
    *   Uploads artifacts to S3.
    *   Creates/Updates a **SageMaker Serverless Endpoint**.
    *   Configures auto-scaling (0 to N instances).
6.  **Create API Gateway**:
    *   Deploys an **AWS Lambda** function to act as a proxy.
    *   Sets up an **API Gateway** HTTP API to expose the model publicly.
7.  **Test Endpoint**: Sends a test request ("I love this movie") to the live API to verify end-to-end functionality.
8.  **Notify**: Sends an email alert upon success or failure.
